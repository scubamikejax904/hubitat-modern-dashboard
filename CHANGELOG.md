# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Scheduler MVP (Phase 1): create, edit, enable/disable, delete, and test schedules from the dashboard.
  - Triggers: daily, weekly (day-of-week picker), and one-time (date+time picker); one-time schedules self-delete after firing.
  - Actions: lights (per-room or per-device on/off, dimming for dimmers, white-balance for CT-capable devices), thermostats (mode, heat/cool setpoints, fan mode), and hub mode.
  - Each schedule shows last run and next run; per-row toggle with distinct enabled/disabled colors.
  - Groovy backend persists schedules in `state.schedulesJson`, arms jobs via Quartz `schedule()` (daily/weekly) and `runOnce()` (one-time), recomputes next-fire with a 7-field cron parser, re-arms on `updated()`/`installed()`, and prunes past one-time schedules every 5 minutes. Endpoints: `/schedules` (GET), `/schedules/save`, `/schedules/delete`, `/schedules/toggle`, `/schedules/test`.
- Scheduler infrastructure: fourth JS chunk (`mld-app-post3.js`) housing the scheduler UI; build enforces 128 KB limit on all four app chunks.

## 0.1.9

- Local/cloud mode switching: overflow menu links, editable local URL, Android cloud banner, and remembered local access.
- House snapshot slides on **All on** / **All off** with slide-confirm thumb UI; refined room snapshot gesture and animation.
- App JS split into three File Manager chunks (`mld-app-post2.js`) to stay under hub size limits.
- Light command metering uses `runInMillis`; snapshot timestamps use Hubitat `now()`.

## 0.1.8

- Motorized shades & blinds: device picker, room tiles, quick popup with open/close/pause and drag-to-position.
- Light snapshots: slide-to-save and slide-to-restore per room or whole house.
- Bulk room/house light on/off; configurable metering, on/off optimization, and activation optimization for snapshots.
- Build-time size checks for `mld-app-pre.js` and `mld-sw.js`.

## 0.1.7

- Default dashboard and PWA title renamed to **mDash**.
- HSM quick popup: shield icons for arm/disarm modes and cancel-alert button.
- Fix music master transport and popup close across JS chunks (`postCall`); build-time check for part-1/part-2 symbol leaks.
