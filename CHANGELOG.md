# Changelog

## 0.2.49

- Thermostat fan modes: read `supportedThermostatFanModes` when drivers expose it
  (fallback to `supportedFanModes`).
- Thermostat mode buttons: enforce `display: none` when hidden so unsupported modes
  do not leave empty gaps in the dial popup.

## 0.2.48

- Sensors tab: room headers collapse/expand on tap, expand/collapse-all works in
  Sensors view, and rooms start expanded unless previously collapsed.
- Lights view: hide room On/Off controls when a room has no lights.

## 0.2.47

- Sensors view grouped by Hubitat room with collapsible room sections, type
  sub-labels within each room, and search/filter support across the room layout.

## 0.2.46

- Companion app preferences cleanup: unlock PIN lives under **Locks / garage
  doors**; thermostat quick-menu toggle sits with the thermostat picker (removed
  separate Locks and Thermostats sections).

## 0.2.45

- Companion app: locks and garage door openers moved to a dedicated **Locks /
  garage doors** preferences section (clearer than mixing with other device types).

## 0.2.44

- Garage door support in the **Locks** quick-nav popup: select devices with
  `capability.garageDoorControl`, open/close controls, favorites, and optional
  unlock PIN on open (same PIN as locks).

## 0.2.43

- Fix Sensors tab empty for authorized non-temperature sensors: Hubitat can leave
  Groovy field constants null (same class of bug as session TTL). Sensor type
  tables are now methods, and device pickers are read via direct input fields
  instead of `settings[name]`.

## 0.2.42

- Dashboard password sessions: use `dashSessionTtlMs()` method instead of a Groovy
  field (Hubitat could leave the constant null); safer session sequence handling.

## 0.2.41

- Dashboard password sessions: store opaque tokens in hub state with sliding 7-day
  renewal via new `/auth/renew` endpoint (replaces signed tokens that broke on hub
  password changes and sandbox limits). Client renews server-side on activity.

## 0.2.40

- Fix multi-sensors disappearing from the Sensors view when they are also
  authorized as temperature sensors or another dashboard device type.
- Add an **Other / generic sensors** picker for devices that only expose
  Hubitat's base Sensor capability.

## 0.2.39

- Remove optional offline device indicator (deferred; see
  [docs/deferred/offline-device-status.md](docs/deferred/offline-device-status.md)).

## 0.2.38

- Category quick-nav icons align left (scrollable row) instead of centered.

## 0.2.37

- Optional **Show inactive devices as offline** companion setting (removed in 0.2.39).

## 0.2.36

- Dashboard password: re-sync session from localStorage after unlock; derive expiry
  from signed token prefix when missing; retry /data once on 401 before re-prompting.

## 0.2.35

- Dashboard password unlock: avoid `Long.toHexString` and `JsonOutput.toJson` in the
  unlock handler (Hubitat sandbox blocks them); use decimal djb2 sig and manual JSON.
- Unlock errors now include a `detail` field surfaced in the password gate UI.

## 0.2.34

- Dashboard password unlock: use stateless signed sessions (djb2 hash) instead of
  server-side session map — avoids Hubitat sandbox failures from `Random` and
  session state writes that caused "an unexpected error occurred" on unlock.

## 0.2.33

- Dashboard password sessions: store opaque tokens in app state instead of
  SHA-256/HMAC (Hubitat sandbox blocks `MessageDigest`). Unlock and API calls now
  renew sessions server-side; client uses `expiresAt` from the hub.

## 0.2.32

- Dashboard password gate: skip polling/refresh while the gate is open; dedupe
  concurrent `ensureDashboardAccess` calls; avoid clearing the password field when
  the gate is already showing.

## 0.2.31

- Outlets tab: dedicated card layout with centered socket graphic, status, and name
  (2-column grid); room tiles keep the compact inline layout.

## 0.2.30

- Category tabs on by default for new users (localStorage unset → enabled).
- Outlets quick-nav and tile icon use a blue gradient socket graphic.

## 0.2.29

- Fix Category tabs / non-Lights views crashing with `ReferenceError: activeTab is
  not defined`. The chunk rewriter treated ternary `? activeTab : …` like an object
  key and skipped the `M.` prefix after the 0.2.28 core split.

## 0.2.28

- Fix cloud dashboard blank after 0.2.27: Hubitat cloud gateway times out serving
  `mld-app.js` above ~120 KB (`HTTP 504`, `globalThis.__MLD` never loads). Split
  thermostat/core UI into new `mld-app-core.js` so `mld-app.js` is ~41 KB again.
- Keep shared sensor state (`sensors[]`, `replaceList`, etc.) in bootstrap `mld-app.js`
  so `render()` can hydrate `/data` without crashing.
- File Manager install is now 12 files (add `mld-app-core.js`).

## 0.2.27

- Fix dashboard password flow on hub: validate session expiry from the token (not only
  client-side sliding expiry), retry auth after HTTP 401 instead of showing a generic
  connection error, and fall back to GET unlock when POST body parsing fails on Hubitat.
- Bust browser cache after updates: script/CSS URLs in `mld-index.html` include the app
  version query string so hubs no longer keep serving stale JS after File Manager uploads.

## 0.2.26

- Fix password unlock hanging forever: `closeDashboardGate()` cleared `gateState`
  before the unlock promise could resolve, so `/data` never loaded after Unlock.

## 0.2.25

- Fix blank dashboard after password feature: move password-gate UI out of
  `mld-app.js` into `mld-app-post2.js`. Part1 was only ~3 KB under Hubitat's 128 KB
  File Manager limit and could truncate on upload.

## 0.2.23

- Optional dashboard password: enable in app preferences to require a password
  before the dashboard loads. Successful unlock keeps a server-signed session that
  slides forward for seven days while the dashboard is used; after a week of
  inactivity the password is required again.
- Dashboard session expiry uses Hubitat `now()` instead of `System.currentTimeMillis()`.
- Fix valve Open/Close UI not updating after visiting Sensors then Favorites:
  `updateSensorCard` preferred detached Sensors-tab cards over live Favorites cards.

## 0.2.22

- Re-land valve controls and sensor normalization with fixes for the blank-dashboard
  regression from 0.2.18/0.2.20:
  - Hubitat valves picker uses `capability.valve` (lowercase).
  - Sensor/valve UI moved into `mld-app-post2.js` so `mld-app-post.js` stays near the
    previously working ~118 KB size.
  - `/data` without a `valves` array no longer breaks room/light rendering.

## 0.2.21

- Revert 0.2.20 (valve controls and sensor normalization) — restores the previous
  stable release.

## 0.2.20

- Re-land valve controls and sensor normalization from 0.2.18.
- Fix Hubitat valves picker: use `capability.valve` (lowercase). Capital
  `capability.Valve` in 0.2.18 could break Groovy compile and leave the dashboard
  shell empty aside from All on/All off.

## 0.2.19

- Revert 0.2.18 (valve controls and sensor normalization) — restores the previous
  stable release.

## 0.2.19

- Revert 0.2.18 (valve controls and sensor normalization) — restores the previous
  stable release.

## 0.2.17

- Companion app option **Show outlets in separate Outlets tab** — when enabled,
  outlets move from Lights room cards to a dedicated Outlets quick-nav view.
- Removed **Switches (not lights or outlets)** companion app picker — plain
  switches had no dashboard UI; use **Outlets** or **Lights** instead.

## 0.2.16

- Outlets appear as socket-style tiles in rooms (favorites supported); room and
  house on/off and light snapshots still control lights only.

## 0.2.15

- HPM manifest and README link to the published Hubitat Community release thread.

## 0.2.14

- Nav reorder mode: drag-only (no arrow buttons), handle above each icon; search bar hidden while reordering.

## 0.2.13

- Reorder category nav icons (lights, locks, scenes, etc.) alongside rooms; order syncs across devices via the hub.
- Popup panels use safer viewport sizing on narrow screens; lock PIN hint wraps long text.
- Scheduler view stays in sync when switching tabs or popups.

## 0.2.12

- Central thermostat target menu: toggle select-all off, deselect individual units down to none; controls disable when nothing is selected.

## 0.2.11

- All-thermostats popup: choose which thermostats to control via a multi-select target menu.
- Favorites star only appears for devices that support favorites.

## 0.2.10

- All-lights and room slide buttons: tap works reliably; incomplete slides no longer fire a ghost click.
- App resume refreshes data without resetting open popups unless the page was hidden.

## 0.2.9

- Unified slider thumb positioning across tile dimmers, shade sliders, level tracks, and color-temperature controls (shared inset math and edge gutters).
- Tile dimmer sliders use an inner clip layer so the warm gradient and dim overlay match popup/scheduler tracks.

## 0.2.8

- Scheduler time picker: tap hour or minute to open a scroll-wheel sheet (12h and 24h).
- Level/dimmer track uses an inner clip layer so the warm gradient and dim overlay align at the edges.

## 0.2.7

- Scheduler time picker uses +/- stepper buttons with hold-to-repeat (12h and 24h).
- Dimmer and color-temperature slider thumbs align correctly at track edges via CSS positioning.
- Scheduler device-action step gets clearer headings, hints, and room-grouped layout.

## 0.2.6

- Dimmer sliders and color-popup level track use a warm brightness gradient with a dim overlay (matches tile drag-to-dim behavior).
- Scheduler brightness and white-balance controls use the same drag tracks instead of native range inputs.

## 0.2.5

- Sensor cards show battery percentage in the bottom-left corner (temperature sensors and other sensors with a battery attribute).
- Temperature sensor battery included in `/data` and updated live via WebSocket.

## 0.2.4

- PIN pad shows a clear "Wrong PIN. Try again." message on incorrect entry (HSM and lock unlock).

## 0.2.3

- HSM popup semantic state colors: status banner, mode buttons, and section labels reflect armed, arming, disarmed, monitoring, and alert states.
- HSM backend subscribes to `hsmStatus`/`hsmAlert` events and persists state for more reliable status after commands and refreshes.

## 0.2.2

- Optional navigation drawer: overflow menu toggle moves search and category icons into a side menu; topbar shows the active category (Lights, Scheduler, etc.).
- Scheduler 12/24-hour display preference in app settings; times stay stored in 24-hour form for reliable firing.

## 0.2.1

- Scheduler UI touch optimization: larger tap targets, improved typography, and row/room-header tap-to-toggle on device pickers.
- Fix scheduler nav flicker by decoupling visibility from post3 chunk load.

## 0.2.0

- Scheduler MVP (Phase 1): create, edit, enable/disable, delete, and test schedules from the dashboard.
  - Triggers: daily, weekly (day-of-week picker), and one-time (date+time picker); one-time schedules self-delete after firing.
  - Actions: lights (per-room or per-device on/off, dimming for dimmers, white-balance for CT-capable devices), thermostats (mode, heat/cool setpoints, fan mode), and hub mode.
  - Each schedule shows last run and next run; per-row toggle with distinct enabled/disabled colors.
  - Groovy backend persists schedules in `state.schedulesJson`, arms jobs via Quartz `schedule()` (daily/weekly) and `runOnce()` (one-time), recomputes next-fire with a 7-field cron parser, re-arms on `updated()`/`installed()`, and prunes past one-time schedules every 5 minutes. Endpoints: `/schedules` (GET), `/schedules/save`, `/schedules/delete`, `/schedules/toggle`, `/schedules/test`.
- Scheduler Phase 3: sunrise and sunset triggers with minute offsets for daily and weekly schedules.
  - Sun-based schedules use `runOnce` and re-arm on fire, at midnight, and when hub `sunriseTime`/`sunsetTime` events update.
  - Dashboard step 1 offers Clock / Sunrise / Sunset with preset and custom offsets; shows today's computed time when available via `sunTimes` in `/data`.
- Scheduler Phase 4: hub mode as trigger and optional mode condition on time-based schedules.
  - **When mode changes** trigger fires via `subscribe(location, "mode", …)` when the hub enters the selected mode.
  - **Restrict to modes** optional condition on daily, weekly, once, and sun-time schedules; hidden for mode triggers.
- Scheduler Phase 2: switches and outlets as separate scheduler action types.
  - Companion app device pickers for plain switches and outlets; streamed in `/data` as `plainSwitches` and `outlets`.
  - Scheduler workflow step 2 shows Switches/Outlets only when devices are configured; step 3 supports per-room selection with on/off only.
- Scheduler infrastructure: fourth JS chunk (`mld-app-post3.js`) housing the scheduler UI; build enforces 128 KB limit on all four app chunks.

## 0.1.9

- Local/cloud mode switching: overflow menu links, editable local URL, Android cloud banner, and remembered local access.
- House snapshot slides on **All on** / **All off** with slide-confirm thumb UI; refined room snapshot gesture and animation.
- App JS split into three File Manager chunks (`mld-app-post2.js`) to stay under hub size limits.
- Light command metering uses `runInMillis`; snapshot timestamps use Hubitat `now()`.

## 0.1.8

- Motorized shades & blinds: device picker, room tiles, quick popup with open/close/pause and drag-to-position.
- Light snapshots: slide-to-save and slide-to-restore per room or whole house.
- Bulk room/house light on/off; configurable metering, on/off optimization, and activation optimization for snapshots.
- Build-time size checks for `mld-app-pre.js` and `mld-sw.js`.

## 0.1.7

- Default dashboard and PWA title renamed to **mDash**.
- HSM quick popup: shield icons for arm/disarm modes and cancel-alert button.
- Fix music master transport and popup close across JS chunks (`postCall`); build-time check for part-1/part-2 symbol leaks.

## 0.1.6

- Documentation pass: community post draft, HPM registry guide, CHANGELOG, NOTICE, bundle READMEs, PWA description, generated `repository.json`, setup page copy.
- Groovy Devices section intro; `communityLink` in HPM manifest (update URL after forum post).

## 0.1.5

- Updated HPM, README, and SmartApp descriptions emphasizing minimal setup, smart device names, PWA, and hub-only hosting.
- Apache 2.0 LICENSE; author and version metadata centralized in `build.mjs`.

## 0.1.4

- HPM asset URLs track `master/dist` for reliable updates.
- README documents custom repository URL and common HPM update pitfalls.

## 0.1.3

- Cross-chunk `postCall` fixes for lock/music optimistic popups and thermostat quick-popup refresh.

## 0.1.2

- Hub mode icons and thermostat popup fixes.

## 0.1.1

- Expanded HPM package description.
