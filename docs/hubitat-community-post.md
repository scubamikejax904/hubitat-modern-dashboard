# Hubitat Community release post

**Published:** https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-modern-dashboard-mdash-minimal-setup-pwa-with-built-in-scheduler-runs-entirely-on-your-hub/165028

`COMMUNITY_LINK` in `build.mjs` points at this thread (also set in HPM manifests on build).

**Full feature documentation:** see the [User guide](../README.md#user-guide) in the README (WebSocket, snapshots, iOS PWA/local mode, scheduler details, and more).

Original draft body kept below for reference.

Screenshots help a lot — capture from your hub or from the local preview
(`node preview/server.mjs` → http://localhost:4321/). Attach a few images of the
main lights view, scheduler, and phone home-screen icon if you can.

**Title:** Modern Dashboard (mDash) — control-first PWA with bulk actions & scheduler, runs entirely on your hub

**Body:**

## Modern Dashboard for Hubitat

I built a mobile-first dashboard that tries to stay out of your way — and that is
designed around **control**, not just viewing status.

Most dashboards are status boards. This one is optimized for *doing* things:
large touch targets, drag-to-dim, and **bulk device control** so you can turn off
a whole room's lights, the whole house, or adjust multiple thermostats at once.

**Select your devices and you're done.** No layout builder, no grouping rules, no
Maker API setup. Rooms and names come from your Hubitat room assignments. You
*can* customize a few things later, but you don't have to.

### What makes it different

1. **Control-first UI** — built for acting on devices quickly, including bulk
   room/house lights and multi-thermostat control. Status is available; control
   is the priority.
2. **Minimal-effort configuration** — install the app, pick devices, open the
   link. Layout is automatic from Hubitat rooms. Optional tweaks (theme,
   favorites, nav order, PINs) are available when you want them.
3. **Installable PWA** — open the cloud URL on your phone and add it to your home
   screen (Android: Install app; iOS Safari: Add to Home Screen). It opens like a
   standalone app with its own icon (**mDash**).
4. **Simple remote scheduler** — create and manage schedules from the dashboard
   itself, including when you're away. No Hubitat admin login, no Rule Machine,
   no external service — same OAuth dashboard URL you already use for control.
5. **Runs completely on your hub** — UI, API, scheduler, snapshots, and favorites
   all live on the hub. No third-party cloud backend. Remote access uses Hubitat's
   own cloud proxy when you want it.

### Features at a glance

- **Lights** — room-grouped tiles, drag-to-dim, RGB / color temperature, **per-room
  and whole-house on/off**, light snapshots (slide to save/restore)
- **Scheduler** — daily, weekly, one-time, sunrise/sunset (with offsets), and hub
  mode triggers; actions for lights, outlets, thermostats, and hub mode
- **Climate** — thermostat dial (setpoints, mode, fan) and **multi-select bulk
  thermostat control**
- **Security & home** — locks (optional PIN), HSM arm/disarm (optional PIN),
  Hubitat scenes, hub mode
- **Shades / blinds** — open/close/pause and drag-to-position
- **Ceiling fans** — on/off and speed control on a dedicated Fans tab
- **Music / media** — Sonos, Echo Speaks, AirPlay, Chromecast (where supported)
- **Sensors** — motion, contact, shock/glass-break, water, presence, humidity,
  illuminance, smoke/CO, temperature (+ battery when available)
- **UX** — dark/light/auto theme, search, collapsible rooms, favorites, reorderable
  rooms and nav icons (synced across devices), local ↔ cloud switching

Standalone switches (relay modules, exhaust fans, etc.) have no separate tile type.
Add them to the **Lights** or **Outlets** picker to control them from the dashboard
or scheduler. Outlets use socket-style tiles; enable **separate Outlets tab** in
app settings to show them outside the Lights room view.

### Install (HPM — recommended)

1. Open **Hubitat Package Manager** on your hub.
2. **Install** (or search) → **Modern Dashboard**
3. **Apps → Add User App → Modern Dashboard** → select devices → **Done**
4. Open the **Cloud** link from the app page
5. On your phone: install as a PWA / Add to Home Screen if you like
6. Tap the **Scheduler** icon to add schedules you can manage remotely

The package is listed in HPM's default repository — no custom repository URL is
required. HPM enables OAuth and deploys the File Manager assets automatically.

**Updates:** use HPM **Update**. If files look stale after **Match Up**, use
**Repair** on the package.

### Manual / bundle install

See the [README](https://github.com/evdev/hubitat-modern-dashboard#readme) for
bundle and paste-into-Apps-Code instructions (upload 12 `mld-*` files to File
Manager, enable OAuth).

### Security note

The cloud URL includes your OAuth access token (Hubitat's normal pattern). Treat
it like a secret — anyone with the URL can control the devices you've selected.
If you regenerate the token, open a fresh cloud link and reinstall the PWA.

Feedback, feature requests, and screenshots welcome in this thread. Happy to
answer questions about setup, the scheduler, or how it compares to the built-in
dashboard / other community dashboards.
